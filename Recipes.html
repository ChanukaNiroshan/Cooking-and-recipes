<h3>Ingredients</h3>
1 cup Basmati rice,
2 cups water,
Salt to taste <br><br>

2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon ginger, grated
1 teaspoon cumin powder
1 teaspoon coriander powder
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
1 cup mixed vegetables (carrots, peas, potatoes, etc.)
1 cup coconut milk or water
Salt to taste
Fresh coriander leaves for garnish (optional)

<h3>Cooking instructions</h3>
Rinse the Basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. This helps remove excess starch.<br><br>

Optional: Soak the rice in water for about 15-30 minutes. This helps the rice cook more evenly<br><br>

In a pot, bring 2 cups of water to a boil,
Add the soaked and drained rice to the boiling water,
Add salt to taste,
Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and simmer for 15-20 minutes or until the rice is tender and the water is absorbed,
Fluff the rice with a fork.<br><br>

In a pan, heat vegetable oil over medium heat,
Add chopped onions and sauté until they become translucent,
Add minced garlic and grated ginger, sauté for another minute<br><br>

Add cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, and red chili powder. Cook the spices for a minute to release their flavors.<br><br>

Add the mixed vegetables and stir well to coat them with the spices,
Cook for a few minutes until the vegetables begin to soften<br><br>

Pour in coconut milk or water. Bring the mixture to a simmer,
Season with salt to taste,
Let it simmer until the vegetables are fully cooked and the curry reaches the desired consistency<br><br>

Serve the vegetable curry over the steamed Basmati rice,
Garnish with fresh coriander leaves if desired.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
2 cups raw rice
1/2 cup cooked rice
1/4 cup urad dal (black gram lentils)
1/2 teaspoon fenugreek seeds
1 teaspoon active dry yeast (optional, for fermentation)
Salt to taste
Coconut oil or any vegetable oil
Extra oil or ghee for greasing the hopper pan

<h3>Cooking instructions</h3>

Rinse the raw rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds. Soak them in water for at least 4-6 hours or overnight,
Grind the soaked rice, urad dal, fenugreek seeds, and cooked rice into a smooth batter. Add water as needed to achieve a pouring consistency,
If you prefer, you can ferment the batter by adding active dry yeast and letting it sit in a warm place for 6-8 hours or overnight. Fermentation is optional but enhances the flavor<br><br>

Heat a hopper pan or appam pan over medium heat,
Grease the pan with a little oil or ghee.<br><br>

Pour a ladleful of batter into the center of the pan,
Lift the pan and swirl it around to spread the batter thinly, coating the sides to create a bowl shape.<br><br>

Cover the pan with a lid and let the hopper cook over low to medium heat,
Cook until the edges become crispy, and the center is soft. This usually takes about 2-3 minutes<br><br>

Carefully remove the hopper from the pan using a spatula,
Repeat the process with the remaining batter.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
2 cups rice flour,
1 1/2 to 2 cups hot water,
1/2 teaspoon salt 

<h3>Cooking instructions</h3>
In a large mixing bowl, add rice flour and salt (if using),
Gradually add hot water while stirring continuously to form a smooth, lump-free dough. The consistency should be such that the dough is firm enough to hold its shape but soft enough to be extruded through the string hopper press.<br><br>

Once the dough is ready, fill the string hopper press or idiyappam maker with the dough. If you don't have a string hopper press, you can use a potato ricer with a fine-holed disc.<br><br>

Hold the string hopper press over the idli steamer or a large pot of boiling water.
Press the dough through the small holes in a circular motion to create thin, delicate noodles. You can make a single layer or create a nest-like structure.<br><br>

If using an idli steamer, steam the string hoppers for about 5-7 minutes or until they are cooked through and firm.
If you don't have an idli steamer, you can improvise by placing a steaming rack over a pot of boiling water. Place the string hoppers on the rack, cover with a lid, and steam.<br><br>

Once cooked, carefully remove the string hoppers from the steamer using a spatula.
